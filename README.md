# tinyhtmlmd

## About

This is a html2markdown converter for the specific README.md(a html file) generated by
[leethub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub).

I have done the following:

* The title will be converted to a first-level title .
* The degree of difficulty will be converted into a secondary heading and `"## 1. Problem Description - "` will be added
  before it.
* html \<pre> codeblock converted to markdown codeblock with `text` property.
* \<strong> will be removed when it appers in codeblock.
* The \<hr> tag will be filtered out for the title of the github pages comes with a split line.
* `"\n\n## 2. Solutions\n"` will be added at the end of the file(it only works in `rt` command).
